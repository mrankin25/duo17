                        Classical crossover duo, baritone Jean Bernard Cerin and pianist Veena K. Kulkarni fuse classical and world music with story telling into transformative concert experiences.  With Indian-Filipino-American and Haitian backgrounds, Veena and Jean Bernard synthesize a broad cultural heritage with their western classical training to explore music from all around the globe. Together, they bring new sounds to conventional classical music audiences and share this classical music tradition with new audiences.
                        
                        “Forgo the coffee the night you intend to hear Duo 1717. Kulkarni & Cerin break with tradition to bring you a potpourri of highly entertaining works that will keep you on the edge of your seats until it’s time for the standing ovation!” – pianist, Waleed Howrani

                        <span class="name">JEAN BERNARD CERIN</span> has charmed audiences throughout the United States, France, Austria and his native Haiti.  An avid recitalist and concert singer, this season he returned to the Philadelphia Bach Festival for which the Chestnut Hill Local commended his “burnished tones.” He also joined the The College of New Jersey Wind Band for Armando Bayolo’s “Last Breaths.”  Most recently, Jean Bernard sang Raphael in Haydn’s Creation with the Greater South Jersey chorus.  Jean Bernard did his undergraduate studies at St. Joseph’s University and pursued graduate studies at the New England Conservatory and the University of Michigan. He is on faculty at St. Joseph’s University,  Lincoln University and Washington College.

                        Lead Instructor at the Faber Piano Institute in Ann Arbor, <span class="name">VEENA K. KULKARNI</span> delights in teaching students of all ages from the earliest years of study through advanced concert repertoire.

Veena has led contemporary worship at the Ann Arbor Christian Reformed Church for over 12 years, giving her the fluency in style and versatility that are central to Duo 1717.  Veena was also the pianist for Eero Trio, whose CD Wolf Glen was released in 2010 and features the premiere recording of Christopher Dietz’s Fumeux fume, for clarinet, cello & piano.  Veena completed her doctorate in Piano Performance and Pedagogy under Logan Skelton and John Ellis at the University of Michigan and has also taught at Madonna University and the University of Windsor.
